HerbI Fresh Curd","Experience the rich, creamy goodness of HerbI Fresh Curd with our unique, handcrafted flavors made from the finest natural ingredients.
HerbI Fresh Curd redefines wellness with a delicious fusion of time-tested herbs and vibrant fruit essences. Crafted from 100% organic milk and enriched with naturally functional ingredients like nutmeg, ashwagandha, and clove, each curd variant is thoughtfully designed to support both taste and health. Whether it’s the soothing blend of mango and nutmeg, the revitalizing mix of pineapple and ashwagandha, or the digestive harmony of strawberry and clove, every spoonful offers a unique balance of flavor and function. Free from artificial additives and preservatives, HerbI Fresh Curd delivers a probiotic-rich, nutrient-packed experience rooted in tradition and inspired by innovation.
Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) is known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and digestive properties. When paired with mango essence, which imparts a tropical sweetness and consumer familiarity, this combination creates a curd that is both flavorful and functionally rich. Nutmeg adds a warm, mildly spicy note that balances the sweet mango flavor, potentially supporting relaxation and digestive health.
Clove (Syzygium aromaticum) is valued for its antimicrobial, analgesic, and antioxidant properties, primarily due to the presence of eugenol. Its strong, aromatic profile is mellowed by the sweet, fruity notes of strawberry essence. This pairing not only enhances the curd’s palatability but may also contribute to oral health and digestive balance.
Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), a revered adaptogenic herb in Ayurveda, is recognized for its ability to reduce stress, boost immunity, and support stamina. Pineapple essence offers a bright, tangy flavor that complements ashwagandha’s slightly bitter, earthy profile. Together, they form a refreshing and rejuvenating curd, catering to both taste and wellness seekers.
Our curd contains live probiotic cultures that support a healthy gut microbiome, improving digestion and nutrient absorption.
We use only natural ingredients with no artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors. Just pure, wholesome goodness.
Packed with calcium and vitamin D, our curd supports strong bones and teeth while aiding muscle function.
Enjoy it plain, as a smoothie base, in baking, or as a savory dip. Our curd is incredibly versatile in the kitchen.
